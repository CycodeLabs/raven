  severity: low
  description: Unpinnable actions can lead to software supply chain attacks.
  full-description: |
    Actions can be pinned to a specific version to ensure that the same version is used
    every time the workflow is run. Even if the action is pinned, if that action itself
    uses an unpinned Docker Image or GitHub Action, the action can be updated without
    the workflow being updated. This can lead to software supply chain attacks.
