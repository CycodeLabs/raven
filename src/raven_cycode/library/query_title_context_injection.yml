  name: Title Context Injection
  severity: critical
  description: Title Injection is caused by using title variables in inline scripts
  full-description: |
    Issues, comments, discussions and PR titles can contain any text and special characters.
    By using a body variable in an inline script, an attacker can inject arbitrary code
    into the build process.
