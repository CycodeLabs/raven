info:
  name: Build Artifact Leaks the GitHub Token
  severity: critical
  description: Including `actions/checkout` and `actions/upload-artifact` in a workflow can expose the `GITHUB_TOKEN` in the build artifact if the root directory is uploaded.
  full-description: |
    When you use the `actions/checkout` action, the `GITHUB_TOKEN` is automatically added to the 
    `.git/config` file. If you subsequently use the `actions/upload-artifact` action with the path
    set to the root directory, the `.git/config` file will be included in the build artifact.
    This can expose the `GITHUB_TOKEN` within the artifact.
