### Example-1
This Cypher query identifies workflows triggered by events like issue comments, issues, or pull request targets that depend on specific GitHub event-related data.
``` cypher
MATCH (w:Workflow)-[*]->(d:StepCodeDependency)
WHERE
    (
        "issue_comment" in w.trigger OR
        "issues" in w.trigger OR
        "pull_request_target" in w.trigger
    ) AND
    (
        d.param IN ["github.event.issue.title", "github.event.issue.body", "github.event.pull_request.title", "github.event.pull_request.body", "github.event.comment.body", "github.event.review.body", "github.event.review_comment.body", "github.event.pages.*.page_name", "github.event.commits.*.message", "github.event.head_commit.message", "github.event.head_commit.author.email", "github.event.head_commit.author.name", "github.event.commits.*.author.email", "github.event.commits.*.author.name", "github.event.pull_request.head.ref", "github.event.pull_request.head.label", "github.event.pull_request.head.repo.default_branch", "github.head_ref"]
    )
RETURN DISTINCT w.path;
