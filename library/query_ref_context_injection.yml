  name: Branch Context Injection
  severity: high
  description: Branch Injection is caused by using ref/default_branch variables in inline scripts
  full-description: |
    Creating a new pull request could be submitted with a branch name that contains special characters.
    By using a ref/default_branch variable in an inline script, an attacker can inject arbitrary code into the build process.
