  name: Privilege Escalation Workflow Run
  severity: critical
  description: Injection of malicious code that triggers a workflow run pipeline can lead to privilege escalation.
  full-description: |
    Pull request pipeline runs without access to secrets.
    However, if a workflow run is triggered by a pull request, the workflow run will have access to secrets.
    Meaning, if an attacker can inject malicious code into the PR workflow and pass the malicious code to the workflow run,
    the attacker can gain access to secrets even though the original workflow did not have access to secrets.
