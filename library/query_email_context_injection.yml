  severity: high
  description: Email Injection is caused by using email variables in inline scripts
  full-description: |
    GitHub allows creating accounts with email addresses that contain special characters,
    such as `+`, `@` and `"`. By using an email variable in an inline script, an attacker
    can inject arbitrary code into the build process.
