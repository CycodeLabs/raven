  name: Pull Request Target Injection
  severity: critical
  description: The pull_request target runs in the context of the base repository, not the fork.
  full-description: |
    A pull request target operates within the context of the base repository,
    which means that any tampering with the build process can potentially lead 
    to the unauthorized extraction of sensitive information, such as secrets.
